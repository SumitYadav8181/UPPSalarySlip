<h2>"Make things that are valuable for others"</h2>

Retouched Version: https://sumityadav8181.github.io/UPPSalarySlip/

Here is how official one looks: https://45.64.159.163/uppolice/employee/sal_idx.php

The official website is not easy to navigate and find something specific you are looking for. Check here -https://uppolice.gov.in

Salary Slip page is most often opened page by most of the working police men and my dad too.

I created this site for my dad for better and clear UI, faster loading because on the official site there are 3-4 scripts are missing still they are there to increase the loading time or delay.


#Extra functionality added-

1- Informing the user if any text or strings are typed in any field

2-Button with javascript to fill the current year and current month instantly, no more guessing

3- More appealing and Fresh UI
